[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/padok-team/yatas-aws/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=OFGny8Za4x)](https://codecov.io/gh/padok-team/YATAS) [![goreport](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/padok-team/yatas-aws)](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/padok-team/yatas)

Yet Another Testing &amp; Auditing Solution

The goal of YATAS is to help you create a secure AWS environment without too much hassle. It won't check for all best practices but only for the ones that are important for you based on my experience. Please feel free to tell me if you find something that is not covered.

## Features
YATAS is a simple and easy to use tool to audit your infrastructure for misconfiguration or potential security issues.

## How to add a new test ?

You'd like to add a new test ? Then simply fork the repository and create a pull request.

### Add a test to an existing category

If the package already exists and has a `getter.go`
- Create a file with the name of the test
- Add your test
- If you need to query the AWS API, add your query to the  `getter.go` file
- Add you test to the `<category_name>.go` file with a new id incremented by 1
- Make sure to add unit tests


### Add a new category

- Create a new folder
- The folder should contain a `getter.go` file
- The folder should contain a `<category_name>.go` file which exports a Run function
- Add your test to the `<category_name>.go` file with a new id incremented by 1
- Add your category in the `<cloudprovider>/<cloudprovider_name>.go` file in the `initTest` function

## How to tests ?

Simply run `make install` and in your Yatas config instead of the version of the plugin use `local` and it will use the version you just installed.

### FYI

All tests are wrapped with a generic functions that allows us to run the test in parallel and disable some without running them.
